Description             : a special speed map made for celebrating the
			  11\11\11 day (actually day of Pocky in japan,
			  Metal Day according to the Dio fan page on
			  facebook and the birthday of the fictional
			  anime charatcher Azusa Nagano), based upon
			  the original game episodes style (but without E4)
			  and also in the style reminds of original doom in
			  some rooms, but mostly looks like a good map from 
			  1994, only with better aligniment on textures and
			  very few detailing cliches here and there. Enjoy.
